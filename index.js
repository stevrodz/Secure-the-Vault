//Pseudocode: I will use JavaScript to create three variables. Each variable will be different in type but similar in action.

const greeting =
  "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:";
console.log(greeting);

var ten = 3 + 7;
let forty = 5 * 8;
const thirtyNine = 50 - 11;

/*variables have been assigned.
each contain the corresponding result of calculation using a unique arithmetic operator.*/

alert("The combination of the lock is " + ten + "-" + forty + "-" + thirtyNine);

//created pop up dialog using alert.
